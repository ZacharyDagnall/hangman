        Welcome to Sam and Zak's Hangman game!! Thanks for....
            _________
            |        |
            |        ğŸ˜‰
            |       \\|/

            |  h a n g i n g 
         ___|___    out
                  with us ;D
        At any point in the game, if you type in "exit", you will be taken out of the current menu/game.
      WELCOME
      puts <<~RULES
        Here are the rules for the game:
        1. You will be provided with a random word in the form of underscores from our database of words with varying difficulty, some can be pretty tough! The amount of underscores matches the amount of letters in the word
        2. You have 10 guess to complete the word, you can guess 1 letter at a time or guess an entire word
        3. When you accumulate 10 incorrect guesses on any given word you lose and are dead! (oh nooo) Your wrong guesses reset upon receiving a new word
        4. You will not be penalized for guessing the same letter or word twice; if you guess 'a' or 'dog' once and it is wrong you will not be penalized for guessing it again
        5. If you correctly guess a letter the underscores will be updated to reflect the placement of that letter within your current word 
        6. If you correctly guess the entire word, good job! You will be given a new word to complete
        7. You will continually get new words as you get each correct until you die. Go for the high score!
        8. If you are stuck on a word and want help type "hint" (the word will never be hint) and you will receive a hint to help you. 
        9. Beware, each hint you use will reduce your points earned by 2. Use hints sparingly!
